  </div>
  <div class="concept-description">
    <p>
     HTML stands for <em>Hypertext Markup
     Language.</em>HTML Documents form the majority of the content on the web.
   </p>
   <p>
     <b>Hypertext Markup Language(HTML)</b> is the standard markup language for creating web pages and web applications. With Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) and JavaScript it forms a triad of cornerstone technologies for the World Wide Web.

          <p>
           The "Tree-like structure" comes from the fact that HTML elements can have other
           elements inside of them.

        <div class ="concept-description">
          <p>
            All HTML elements can be considered as boxes. In CSS, the term "box model" is used when talking about design and layout. The CSS box model is essentially a box that wraps around every HTML element. It consists of: margins, borders, padding, and the actual content.

            An HTML editor is a computer program for editing HTML, the markup of a webpage. Although the HTML markup of a web page can be written with any text editor, specialized HTML editors can offer convenience and added functionality.

         Avoiding Repetition
       </div>
       <div class = "concept-description">
         <p>
           Avoiding repetition is important primarily for the fluidity of your piece.
         </p>
         <p>
          <b>Three tips to avoid repetition:</b>
          <em>(1)</em> Did you ever read a story or article where the main character's name is used way too much? It breaks down the readability of your piece. When you are using a person's name, try replacing it with pronouns whenever possible. Obviously, you must introduce the character you are talking about, and there are still times it is necessary to use the actual name, but when appropriate use him, her, or he, she etc.
          <em>(2)</em> Reread your article out loud, or listen to someone read it to you. Hearing as opposed to reading it inside your head, is helpful for catching those words and phrases that are repetitive. I can't tell you how many times I have read something I wrote to a friend and caught words that repeat.
          <em>(3)</em> Your thesaurus is your friend. Don't be afraid or ashamed to pull it out of your bookshelf, or from your Microsoft Word program. Sometimes you may even find a more appropriate word than you were originally going to use. Plus this blessed little book also has the added bonus of widening your vocabulary.
